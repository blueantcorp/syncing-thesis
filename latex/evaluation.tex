\label{sec:realization}

Realize a proof-of-concept and simulate syncing of data structures
used in the problem scenarios with realistic network latency and
disconnection.

show efficiency both on client-server and peer2peer.

implement same Task Manager with different sync backends\\
--> evaluate ease of integration with app logic

use common web framework like Ember.js/Angular

evaluate code complexity, robustness, performance
