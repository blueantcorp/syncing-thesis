We evaluate the implementation based on the set of requirements specified in section~\ref{sec:requirements}.

Evaluate the proof-of-concept by simulating syncing of data structures
used in the problem scenarios with realistic network latency and
disconnection.

show efficiency both on client-server and peer2peer.

implement same Task Manager with different sync backends

use common web framework like Ember.js or Sencha

make a mobile app

evaluate code complexity, robustness, performance

\section{Task Manager using CouchDB}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Data structure: key-value
\item
  Merging: tree-based
\item
  Propagation: stream-based
\item
  Supports peer-to-peer
\end{itemize}

describe implementation

\section{Task Manager using Histo}

\section{Other Backends}
- Sencha IO (http://www.sencha.com/products/io/) - comes with sync code

- parse.com

- stackmob

- deployd

Most of them simply expose a REST-API but leave all the conflict handling work to the app developer.\\
Are completely centralized.
