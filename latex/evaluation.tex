\chapter{Realization}
\label{sec:realization}

Realize a proof-of-concept and simulate syncing of data structures
used in the problem scenarios with realistic network latency and
disconnection.

TODO:

show efficiency both on client-server and peer2peer.

implement same Task Manager with different sync backends\\
--> evaluate ease of integration with app logic

use common web framework like Ember.js/Angular

evaluate code complexity, robustness, performance

\section{Technologies Used for Implementation}
We describe implementation details like the technologies used, code structure and the testing framework to evaluate the system.

TODO:

\include{app-integration}

- everything web-based --> only way to be cross-platform

- client-side persistence with HTML5

- note on alternatives (Lua, native)
