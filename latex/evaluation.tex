\chapter{Evaluation}\label{evaluation}

We evaluate the implementation based on the set of requirements specified in section~\ref{sec:requirements}.

Evaluate the proof-of-concept by simulating syncing of data structures
used in the problem scenarios with realistic network latency and
disconnection.
