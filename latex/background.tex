Here you discuss some basics for your work and outline existing research in the area of your thesis by citing research papers like~\cite{Lindholm:2009wo} by Lindholm and~\cite{DeCandia:2007ui,Ratner:2001wz} Candia.

\section{Edit-Based Synchronization}
- application has to track each edit

- concurrent edits have to be transformed

- Operational Transformation
  --> complex and error prone

- Commutative Replicated Data Types
  --> data types that only allow changes that commute
  --> no transformation necessary

\section{State-Based Synchronization}
- async through diff computation

- easier to integrate

- Fraser2009 differential sync

\section{Three-Way Merging}
- 3DM tool (Lindholm)

\section{Most Recent Common Ancestor}
- describe problem with graphs

- describe solution referring to standard algo

\section{HTML5 and Offline Applications}
HTML5 specifies a number of client-side storage options. Most are a work in process and still have to be adopted by all browser vendors.

\subsection{Web Storage}
The simplest API is the \emph{localStorage} standard defined in the W3C's Web Storage specification \ref{webstorage}.\\
It provides a key-value store which can store string values for string keys.

- synchronous interface

- space limit

\subsection{Web SQL Database}

\subsection{Indexed Database}

- offline resources
