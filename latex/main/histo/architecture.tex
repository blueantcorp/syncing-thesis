\label{sec:main.histo}

Based on the requirements and the evaluation of CouchDB we derive a new architecture for a practical synchronization solution.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{No Timestamps}: history-based 3-way merging
\item
  \textbf{No Change Tracing}: explicit change tracing is not necessary - support
  diff computation on the fly
\item
  \textbf{Data Agnostic}: leave diff and merge of the actual data to
  plugins
\item
  \textbf{Distributed}: synchronization does not require a central server
\item
  \textbf{Functional Design}: only implement the functional parts of synchronization - leave everything else to the application (transport, persistence)
\item
  \textbf{Sensitive Defaults}: have defaults that `just work' but
  still support custom logic (e.g. for conflict resolution)
\item
  \textbf{Cross-Platform}: be available on every major platform through the use of Web Standards
\end{itemize}
