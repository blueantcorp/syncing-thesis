Inspired by distributed version control for source code we develop Histo, a framework for peer-to-peer data synchronization in mobile apps.
Driven by exemplaric workflows defined for an imaginary collaborative task manager, we derive the requirements that are used to evaluate Histo.
We focus on developing a practical solution that can be implemented with open web standards.
At the core of Histo is a generic data synchronization protocol which is show to be efficient both in peer-to-peer and centralized client-master settings.
