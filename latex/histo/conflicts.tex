Conflicts result in concurrently updating the same structure in different ways.
Section \ref{sec:histo.merging} has shown that in our scenario we have two types of conflicts:

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Value conflicts} happen if a structure's actual value is concurrently updated.
\item \emph{Position conflicts} result of the concurrent movement of the same structure within other structures.
\end{itemize}

An example for a value conflict is the concurrent update of the same key in a dictionary.
Position conflicts can appear in an ordered data structure like an ordered lists.
Even more complex position conflicts could result if we allow the movement of nodes within an entire tree.
Especially the combination of multiple concurrent move operations of multiple nodes can lead to non-trivial conflict scenarios.\\
In our data model we avoided these by not allowing the movement of task instances between projects.
The movement of a task to another project can therefore only be realized through a remove and insert operation effectively copying the data.
Insert and remove operations do usually not result in conflicts.
This an example on how a more constrained data model can limit the number of potential conflicts.\\
The resolution of conflicts is highly application dependent.
In section \ref{sec:histo.merging} we have presented a hierarchical strategy for conflict resolution applied to instance models.
We were able to resolve conflicts identified in a high-level merge by applying a finer grained merge algorithm to the structures affected by the conflicts.\\
The remaining conflicts have to be resolved by the application developer.
The developer is essentially expanding our merge hierarchy by adding another level of merging to resolve the conflicts.\\
This `application merge layer' does not necessarily have to work programatically - in many cases it cannot be.
A common solution is to develop a user interface which allows the user to manually resolve the conflict.\\
In some applications the data is not that critical and conflicts are therefore simply being ignored.
In this case the application effectively `resolves' the conflict by randomly choosing one of the conflicting updates as the `correct' one.\\
Considering the example of conflicting but minor changes to a task title.
A user would most likely be annoyed everytime he is asked to manually resolve a title conflict.\\
A popular compromise is to randomly pick one version as the winner while still keeping the conflicting changes.
