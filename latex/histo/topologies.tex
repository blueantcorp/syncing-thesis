\label{sec:histo.topologies}

In this section we will look at different network topologies to evaluate how they are supported by our synchronization protocol.
We will further explore options for optimization of our protocol with regards to each topology.\\

\subsection{Master - Client}
clients sync only with one node - only remember one remote tracking branch
can safely delete data of previous commits
server can't pull - therefore clients need to push and update server branch
maximal optimization (less data on clients, most efficient syncs)

\subsection{Client - Client}
need to remember remote tracking branch for each client
--> if not it still works but less efficient
can only forget data after least-recently synced client

\subsection{Multi Master - Client}
can easily replace servers even if they are not 100 percent in sync
max optimization on clients

\subsection{Hierarchical}
office server + cloud server)
