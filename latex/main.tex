\chapter{Designing a Synchronization Framework}\label{main}

\section{Application Scenarios}
We describe common synchronization scenarios based on popular mobile applications.

\section{Requirements}
\label{sec:requirements}
From the common scenarios we derive a set of requirements for a synchronization solution.

\section{Evaluation of Existing Systems}
Here we evaluate solutions like CouchDB, Dropbox, iCloud, git, (Parse.com) based on the requirements.

\section{Architecture of Synclib}
Based on the requirements and the evaluation of existing systems we derive a unique architecture for a practical synchronization solution.

\section{Implementation}
We describe implementation details like the technologies used, code structure and the testing framework to evaluate the system.
