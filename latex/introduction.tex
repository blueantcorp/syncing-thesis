\section{Motivation}
Building collaborative apps that sync data among a group of users is
hard.\\The widespread adoption of mobile devices with limited network
access requires the offline availability of data and apps.\\Some aspects
of syncing are often application specific and can therefore not be
solved in a generic way.\\However there are recurring patterns that can
be used to build application specific solutions. The goal of this thesis
is to develop a syncing framework that speeds up the development of
collaborative apps.
