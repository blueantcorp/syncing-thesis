\section{(Managing Changes to Distributed Logic)}
The additional client logic has to be maintained and upgraded for new releases of the application. As the client logic is distributed among all users of the application, a code upgrade becomes more complex to manage than a simple server update. We will see how the same logic used to synchronize application data can be used for updating distributed application code.

- on the server its easy - we can use a distributed version control system

- they don't run on the client -> we need an app-embedded solution
